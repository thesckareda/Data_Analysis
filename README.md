### 🚀 AI Data Analyzer – Level 4 Data Analysis System

📌 Project Overview

This project is the Level 4 Data Analysis System, an AI-powered interactive data analytics platform that integrates:

Automatic statistical insight extraction
Interactive data visualization
Business insights generated by AI
Conversational data analysis

It enables users to upload their own data and analyze it as if they were working with an actual AI Data Analyst.

📊 The 4 Levels of Data Analysis in This Journey

This project is based on a learning and system development framework:

# Level 1 – Basic Data Exploration

Focus: Manual data exploration using pandas.
Features:
- Data loading
- Data shape & column identification
- Missing value identification
- Basic statistical analysis
- Simple data visualization

Objective:
Learn the structure and basic statistics of the data.

# Level 2 – Rule-Based Insight Engine

Focus: Automatic statistical insight extraction (no AI).

System identifies:
- Missing value alerts
- Correlations between variables
- Trend analysis (if datetime field exists)
- Category dominance analysis
- Outliers using IQR method

Objective:
Develop a deterministic analytical system that automatically identifies patterns.

# Level 3 – AI Insight Generator

Focus: Turning structured analytical patterns into human-understandable insights.

Process:
Rule-based engine identifies statistical patterns.
Structured results are passed to Gemini API.
AI produces business insights and explanations.

Objective:
Turn raw statistical results into actionable business stories.

# Level 4 – AI Dashboard + Conversational Data Analyst 

Objective: Building a complete interactive AI analytics tool.

Functionality:
📂 File Upload
Supports CSV and Excel files
Saves dataset in session state

📊 Interactive Visualizations
Pie chart for categorical distribution
Line, Bar, Scatter plots
User-defined axis selection

📌 Initial AI Insights
Automated insights using rule-based engine
AI-generated explanation using Gemini API

💬 Conversational AI Chat
Users can ask questions about their dataset
AI answers purely based on uploaded data
Uses session memory with st.session_state
Caches responses for repeated queries

🧠 Context-Aware Analysis
The AI takes in:
Full dataset context
Previously generated insights
User question and answers with responses that are grounded only in the uploaded data.

🏗 System Architecture
User Upload --> Data Cleaning & Processing --> Rule-Based Insight Engine --> LLM AI Insight Generation --> Interactive Dashboard --> Chat-Based AI Analyst

🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly
- LLM API

🎯 What Makes This Level 3?
This project is more than a dashboard.
It combines:
- Statistical analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Automated insight generation
- Natural language interaction
- Context-aware AI responses
- Interactive visualization

It models a basic AI analytics tool like:
- AI-infused BI tools
- Conversational analytics platforms
- Smart data assistants

📌 Example Use Cases
“Which category generates the most revenue?”
“Are there any significant correlations?”
“Why might profit be volatile?”
“Plot trends over time.”
“Are there any outliers in sales?”
